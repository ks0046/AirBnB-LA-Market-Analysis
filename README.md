# Airbnb & the Future of Home Sharing in Los Angeles

A data-driven analysis of Los Angeles's post-COVID home-sharing market using Airbnb listing data (October 2022 – September 2023), examining market trends, affordability shifts, and the characteristics that drive listing success.

Final project for **Advanced AI & Enterprise Strategy** (Professor Beibei Li) at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.

## Key Findings

### Part A — Where Is the Market Heading?

The LA home-sharing market has fully recovered from COVID and is now consolidating into a professionalized hospitality ecosystem. Three structural shifts stand out:

- **Prices rose every quarter** — median nightly price increased from $138 to $150, reflecting a tightening supply-demand balance
- **Budget listings are disappearing** — affordable listings (<$100/night) dropped from 35% to 31% of total supply in 12 months, while luxury inventory grew from 30% to 34%
- **Listings are getting bigger** — average bedrooms per listing rose from 1.78 to 2.06, signaling a shift toward family and group travel

If these trends persist, LA's Airbnb market will continue moving toward boutique-hotel economics rather than traditional peer-to-peer home sharing.

### Part B — What Makes a Listing Successful?

Across ~172,000 listings, three factors consistently predicted success (defined as high demand + review scores of 95+):

- **Amenity depth** — listings with more amenities (full kitchens, dedicated workspaces, in-unit laundry, parking) significantly outperformed
- **Host responsiveness** — listings with 98-100% response rates achieved success rates roughly 3x higher than those below 80%
- **Guest capacity** — 5-6 guest listings performed best, reflecting demand for family and group-oriented stays
